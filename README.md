## About the project

This game was built as a project for the Udacity Front End Web Developer course. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to load the game

* • Clone the [repo](https://github.com/marceldpr/Udacity-Memory-Game.git) and open the index.html file --or--

## How to play

The game board consists of eight pairs of cards, mixed together in a grid. 
On each turn, the player will choose a card to flip and reveal its underlying symbol, and then, try to find its corresponding pair.
If the cards match, they will stay flipped over, and the player will try to do the same thing with another card.
In case the cards don't match, they will return to their initial hidden state.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

Scoring system:

* • 3 stars: 15 moves or less,
* • 2 stars: 23 moves or less,
* • 1 star: 24 moves or more.
